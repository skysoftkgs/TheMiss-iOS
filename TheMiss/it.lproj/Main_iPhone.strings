Therefore, all the Users of the websites are invited to periodically read this Regulation and to acknowledge any possible changes. This specification applies also to Male Users, who play an active role on themiss.tv in the regular use of the platform. “Male User” shall mean the male person who votes the Miss applicants and the photos he likes, shares them on the social networks and comments the pictures. Instead the maximum age only applies to the applicants to the contest.\n\n1.5 Considering the minimum age established to get access to the website, the User who breaches this minimum age excludes The Miss from any and every responsibility. This responsibility, indeed, should be understood as referred to the User that, at the moment of the registration, has provided reticent and untruthful information and/or data, therefore not in a verifiable manner by the Miss.\n\n1.6 In order to be able to get involved in the activities of the platform provided by the Miss, the User must enter the website www.themiss.tv, or download the app and enter through his/her own account on Facebook or on Instagram or through the registration form to be filled and sent by e-mail.

Once removed, the photo in question will not be visible anymore. In any case, it is strictly forbidden to introduce any contents not related to the purpose of the website www.themiss.tv, that is contents better known as SPAM. This will lead to the exclusion, without notice, from the platform.\n\n1.19  It is forbidden to introduce, in any manner and by any means, contents encouraging terrorist activities and/or behaviours likely to produce or to be considered as criminal actions. \n\nBehaviours liable to incite racial hatred and/or any kind of discrimination are forbidden. The Miss Staff will remove these behaviours, as strictly forbidden by this Regulation.\n\n1.20 It is strictly forbidden to introduce contents or materials liable to infringe intellectual property rights.\n\n1.21 Last but not least, the Users of the platforms are not allowed to introduce and/or to replay other parties’ pictures and/or videos without the consent of the owner/the person concerned. Whoever infringes these rules will be automatically removed from the platform without notice and with no obligation for The Miss Staff to justify it. The exclusion of an User from the website and from its regular activities will lead to the permanent elimination of his/her account and it will not be possible anymore to restore it. \n\n1.22 The introduction of false pictures, videos and data, together with the use of others’ image, is strictly forbidden by the law. Should these behaviours are identified, The Miss will denounce the fact to the appropriate authorities.\n\n1.23  The Miss specifies that in the website www.themiss.tv it is forbidden to save the pictures in the own computer, in order to better protect the contents and the copyrights belonging to the legitimate holders. In the end, The Miss does not accept any liability for any alternative tools and means allowing to save the pictures, as they are not directly manageable.\n\n1.24 However, The Miss has the right to use information and pictures uploaded on the platform, beyond space and time constraints, only for commercial and advertising purposes. In any case, the right to use them shall be exercised by The Miss exclusively for initiatives directly related to the website activities. \n\n1.25 Should the applicants and, in general, the Users accept this Regulation, they license The Miss to use, publish and/or move, at its own discretion and free of charge, the pictures uploaded in the platform to third parties and by any means. In particular, concerning the pictures, The Miss shall be able to manage their publication and their video-promotion, their dissemination through websites, the multimedia presentations, the publication on the Internet of the annual calendar and all the initiatives directly related to the contest. Finally remember that The Miss Staff does not accept any liability for any possible abuse of pictures uploaded in the website. \n\n1.26 In order to guarantee the fair underway of the contest, any possible irregularity identified by the Management of The Miss, concerning the truthfulness of the applicant and her pictures, will lead to the check of the votes obtained. Therefore all the Users of the platform are invited to avoid artifices and/or tricks in order to win the award, otherwise they will be automatically removed from the website. Each vote, indeed, must refer to a single person as a real natural person. \n\n1.27 The contest, to which the website themiss.tv is inspired, was created in order to expressly highlight each applicant’s skills. Therefore the award, given to the Miss who has obtained the highest number of votes during the month, represents and certifies the reward for her own value. \n\n1.28 The prize shall be sent to any destination told in private by the winner to The Miss Staff. Once the prize has been received, the Miss is expressly required to take a picture with this prize, in order to certify the truthfulness and the fair working of the platform.\n\n1.29 In order to obtain the prize, the winner must provide The Miss all pertinent data to send it, otherwise it will not be possible to receive it.\n\nThe registration and the participation to The Miss is conditional on the acceptance of this Regulation in full.";
